# Minesweeper

The classic game Minesweeper in the browser for The Odin Project's [Project: Minesweeper in Javscript](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/minesweeper).

This implementation is made to look and play like the classic Minesweeper--maybe with the exception of the Game Options, which offers the same `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, `Expert`, and `Custom` options but with a different looking form.

Start a new game at anytime by clicking on the smiley face, or change the Game Options at anytime (which will begin a new game with your new options).
