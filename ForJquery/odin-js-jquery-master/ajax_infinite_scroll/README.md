# Infinite Scroll with AJAX

Implementation of infinite scroll with Ajax for The Odin Project's [Project: Infinite Scroll and Submitting a Form with AJAX](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/infinite-scroll-and-submitting-a-form-with-ajax).

Ajax requests are made to the [Open Movie Database (OMDB) API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and movies are displayed in increments of 10 (ie, 10 movies are requested and displayed whenever the user scrolls to the bottom of the page).
