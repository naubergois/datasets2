# Image Carousel/Slider

An Image carousel site for The Odin Project's [Project: Creating an Image Carousel/Slider in Javascript](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/creating-an-image-carousel-slider).

### Basics

The Image carousel site contains arrows on each side of an image to advance to the previous or next image. It automatically moves forward every 5 seconds. It contains little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide is currently displayed (and they are click-able to advance to that particular slide).

### Extras

When you hover on the "next" or "previous" arrows, it pops up a little tiny picture preview of the next or previous slide's picture. If you leave the mouse hovering over the "next" or "previous" arrows, the preview pop up changes as the images keep sliding.

The slides are continuous; they seamlessly wrap. For example, if you click "previous" when you're at the first slide, it will go left to the last slide as if it was positioned immediately to the left of the first slide.
